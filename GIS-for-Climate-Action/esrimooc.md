[A message from Jack Dangermond](https://www.esri.com/training/mooc/player/645d6a07eb82fb767bb0c012/645d6ac3eb82fb767bb0c434/lessons/150631/)

Jack Dangermond is Founder and President of Esri and is recognized as one of the most influential people in the field of geographic information system (GIS) technology. 

The spatial analysis systems that Jack and his company develop help organizations achieve resilience, sustainability, and growth. He launched Esri in 1969 with his wife, Laura Dangermond, in Redlands, California, with the conviction that computer-based mapping and analysis could make critical contributions to geographic planning and environmental science.

A graduate of Harvard University Graduate School of Design, Jack also has received 13 honorary degrees for his contributions to the fields of geography, environmental science, planning, and GIS. Jack remains closely connected to projects, clients, and the company vision and is personally committed to promoting GIS methods to improve environmental stewardship and sustainability for communities across the world.


[ How GIS can help address climate change](https://www.esri.com/training/mooc/player/645d6a07eb82fb767bb0c012/645d6ac3eb82fb767bb0c434/lessons/150631/)

Dr. Dawn Wright, Esri's Chief Scientist, and Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, a leading atmospheric scientist, recently met to discuss the definition of climate change, the key factors contributing to climate change today, and the ways in which GIS can support climate change action. Their conversation introduces climate modeling and the role of GIS and spatial data in efforts to address climate change. Dr. Hayhoe also shares how to find hope and empowerment while acting against climate change.

[Visualizing climate change](https://www.esri.com/training/mooc/player/645d6a07eb82fb767bb0c012/645d6ac3eb82fb767bb0c434/lessons/150631/)

Scientists have been measuring weather variables like temperature and precipitation for more than a century. This historical data has allowed the creation of climate models that can be combined with GIS to visualize and plan for the future impacts of climate change.

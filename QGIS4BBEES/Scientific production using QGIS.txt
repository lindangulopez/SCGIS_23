It provides a low-code environment that enables users to easily import, manipulate, and display various types of geospatial data.


Custom Application Development: QGIS supports the development of custom applications through its application programming interface (API) and plugins. Using QGIS as a low-code tool, developers can create tailored geospatial applications and workflows to address specific needs in the Global South. These applications can range from land management systems to disaster risk assessment tools, promoting efficient and effective decision-making.


Integration with Open Data Sources: QGIS can connect to various open data sources, including global data repositories, national databases, and community-contributed data. By integrating with these sources, QGIS facilitates the use of up-to-date and relevant information in decision-making processes, supporting sustainable development initiatives.


Capacity Building and Knowledge Transfer: QGIS's open-source nature encourages knowledge sharing and capacity building. It enables communities and organisations in the Global South to collaborate, exchange expertise, and develop local GIS skills. Through training programs, workshops, and online resources, QGIS empowers users to participate in the digital transformation process, fostering local ownership and sustainability.


Supporting Participatory Planning: QGIS can facilitate participatory planning processes, allowing stakeholders to engage in decision-making. By integrating local knowledge and community data, QGIS enables more inclusive and context-aware development strategies, ensuring that the digital transformation benefits all segments of society.


Mobile Data Collection: QGIS offers mobile data collection capabilities through its integration with various field data collection applications. This feature is particularly valuable in the Global South, where mobile devices are prevalent, but access to traditional infrastructure is limited. QGIS allows users to collect data in the field, sync it with their GIS projects, and make real-time decisions based on accurate and timely information.

User Conference & Contributor Meeting
The QGIS User Conference '23 is an international 2-day *in person*. The last was held in April,  in The Netherlands. There were presentations and workshops to update users' QGIS knowledge.  Afterwards the 25th QGIS Contributor Meeting took place. In this event for people who contribute to the development of QGIS. It's free to join but you are expected to make yourself useful on improving the QGIS application, documentation or website or anything else QGIS will benefit from.


QGIS is free software and you are under no obligation to pay anything to use it, but you can sponsor the project. The QGIS project aims to empower people with spatial decision-making tools which will result in a better society.

QGIS plays a significant role in supporting the humanitarian work of organizations like the Red Cross by providing powerful geospatial analysis tools, data visualization capabilities, and open-source accessibility. Here are some ways QGIS assists the humanitarian work of the Red Cross:


Disaster response and preparedness: During emergencies and disasters, QGIS enables Red Cross teams to quickly analyze and visualize geospatial data to assess the affected areas, identify vulnerable populations, and plan response efforts. QGIS allows users to overlay various data layers such as population density, infrastructure, and hazard maps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground.


Spatial data management: QGIS provides a platform for managing and organizing spatial data collected during humanitarian operations. It allows Red Cross teams to create and maintain geodatabases, integrate different data sources, and conduct data quality assessments. QGIS also facilitates data sharing and collaboration among team members and stakeholders.


Mapping and visualization: QGIS offers powerful cartographic tools that enable the Red Cross to create high-quality maps for situational awareness, resource allocation, and reporting. It supports the creation of thematic maps, heat maps, and interactive web maps, making it easier to communicate critical information to decision-makers and the affected communities.


Risk and vulnerability assessment: QGIS aids the Red Cross in conducting risk and vulnerability assessments by integrating various data layers such as socio-economic indicators, climate data, and hazard information. The software's geospatial analysis capabilities allow for identifying high-risk areas, understanding exposure patterns, and prioritizing interventions to mitigate risks.


Capacity building and training: QGIS's open-source nature and user-friendly interface make it an ideal tool for capacity building and training programs. Red Cross staff and volunteers can learn and develop their geospatial analysis skills through QGIS training workshops and online resources. This empowers them to utilize spatial data effectively in their humanitarian work.


Collaboration and knowledge sharing: QGIS fosters collaboration and knowledge sharing within the Red Cross community and with other humanitarian organizations. As an open-source software, QGIS allows for customization and extension, enabling Red Cross teams to develop specific tools and workflows tailored to their needs. Additionally, the QGIS community actively shares plugins, tutorials, and best practices, facilitating learning and innovation.


Overall, QGIS provides the Red Cross with a versatile and accessible geospatial platform that enhances their ability to respond to emergencies, conduct assessments, and make informed decisions. Its capabilities contribute to the effectiveness and efficiency of humanitarian operations, ultimately assisting the Red Cross in fulfilling its mission of alleviating human suffering and promoting resilience in communities worldwide.

To find small-scale sport spots in suburban areas using QGIS, you can follow these general steps:


Acquire or create relevant spatial data: Obtain or create a dataset that includes spatial information about sport spots or potential areas where small-scale sports activities can be conducted. This data could include parks, open spaces, community centers, schools, or any other locations suitable for sports.


Import the spatial data into QGIS: Import the spatial dataset into QGIS by adding it as a layer. QGIS supports various file formats such as shapefiles, GeoJSON, or geodatabases. You can use the "Add Vector Layer" option to load the dataset into your project.


Filter the data: Apply filters or queries to narrow down the dataset to specific features or attributes related to small-scale sport spots. For example, you might filter for areas with specific amenities like basketball courts, tennis courts, or open fields suitable for sports activities.


Symbolize and style the sport spots: Customize the appearance of the filtered features to make them visually distinguishable. You can use QGIS's styling options to assign different colors, icons, or symbols to represent different types of sport spots.


Perform spatial analysis: Utilize QGIS's spatial analysis tools to further analyze the sport spots. You can conduct proximity analysis to identify spots within a certain distance from specific locations or analyze the distribution of sport spots within the suburban areas.


Add additional context layers: Enhance your analysis by adding relevant context layers such as road networks, population density, or land use information. This can provide a better understanding of the accessibility and suitability of the sport spots in relation to the surrounding suburban areas.


Explore and visualize the results: Interact with the map and explore the identified sport spots in the suburban areas. Utilize QGIS's visualization capabilities to create maps that clearly display the small-scale sport spots and any additional information you want to showcase.


Share and disseminate the results: Generate maps or reports using QGIS's layout design tools and share them with relevant stakeholders or communities. This can help inform decision-making processes, promote awareness of available sport spots, and encourage community engagement in sports activities.


Remember that the availability and accuracy of the spatial data will influence the quality of your analysis. Obtaining accurate and up-to-date data about sport spots in suburban areas is essential for reliable results. Additionally, customization and specific workflows may vary depending on the specific requirements and available data in your study area.

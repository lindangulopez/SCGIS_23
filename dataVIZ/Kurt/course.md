Hello everyone,
You have registered for the online course Data Visualization with QGIS and it starts a week from today: Tuesday the 6th of June at 14:00 CET. This email contains important details about the course.

Course program and schedule:
The course consists of two online class periods, taught in English, totalling four hours.
Session 1: Tuesday 6/06 from 14.00 - 16.00 (CET)
Session 2: Thursday: 15/06 from 14.00 - 16.00 (CET)
These classes will largely consist of me showing you cartographic and data visualization techniques in QGIS. This allows us to get through more material. However, we may also have some time for you to try some things. So just in case, have your computer with QGIS installed next to you for these course sessions.

Feel free to ask questions at any time during the courses. If you have a question there is a good chance others have the same question ðŸ¤”.

Assignments
You will get very important hands-on experience by completing the assignments. I will give you one after each class period. Please set aside time to do these tasks. You must complete these assignments by Monday the 26th of June to receive the official QGIS course certificate. I will email these assignments to you after each course. They will involve sending me screenshots demonstrating you successfully finished each task. 

Supplementary course material
After the each course period I will send you:
Detailed step-by-step instructions for what was covered
Short YouTube videos on how to do each technique
The assignment
A link to the recording of the session
Q & A Sessions
If you have questions about the techniques, you can log in during the two specified Q & A time periods and ask questions. 
Question / answer session 1: Tuesday 13/06 from 14.00 - 15.00 (CET)
Question / answer session 2: Thursday 20/06 from 14.00 - 15.00 (CET)
During these two periods, you can also ask questions about what I have covered. This is an opportunity for a little "informal" talk about cartography and data visualization in QGIS, including applying the techniques to your data.

Both the course and Q & A sessions will be recorded and YouTube links will be sent to you after each session. This means that you can revisit them if there is something you would like to hear/watch again.

Connecting to the Online Course:
The course is held through Zoom. We will be using this link https://us02web.zoom.us/j/84530891643?pwd=ZnRCbGR6OUlxM2J4RldJd2R1aVE3Zz09 for both course periods and the Q & A sessions.
Let me know if you would like to test your access before the 1st course, and we will find out!

Preparing for the course:
Have QGIS installed - preferably version 3.28. However, most techniques will work with older versions of QGIS - at least back to 3.16. I will be using the English translation of QGIS.
Please watch the course introduction available here https://youtu.be/5HqjuUjpui8 on YouTube. (it takes about 14 minutes). Here I introduce myself and some of the topics covered in the course.
You can download the course data from this Google Drive link. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_WoRFYyyV1W75Nh3F2qT5ittY2wd6WJq/view?usp=share_link Please download it and unzip it. And of course know where you put it on your hard drive ðŸ˜‰.
Questions for you:
I would like to know a little about how you use QGIS and what you hope to learn from this course. Therefore I would like to ask you to send me an email with a few lines:
What operating system do you use? Windows? MacOS? Linux?
What version of QGIS are you using and with what language?
What do you use QGIS for?
How long have you been using QGIS?
Is there anything specific you hope to learn in the course?
See you online next week!
Best,
Kurt

Hi all,

It was great seeing everyone at this morning's workshop on Working with Spatial Data in R Part2. A few quick follow-ups:

I'd be grateful if you could complete the very short evaluation below. This will help me improve the workshop and help us plan trainings for future SCGIS conferences.

The recording from this morning's workshop can be found at the link below. It will stay online for quite some time, but you are welcome to download a copy for posterity.

As mentioned during the workshop, I'll be holding online office hours this Friday 8/18 from 9:20a - 11:20a for anyone who wants to chat more about anything R related, a project you're working on, etc. Sign-up for a time slot here.

As a reminder, all of the workshop materials can be found at: https://ucanr-igis.github.io/rspatial_scgis23/. This website will stay online for quite some time as well, but you can also download the whole thing from GitHub (but I might suggest you wait until the weekend as I'll be making a few updates).
Cheers,
Andy

QGIS Server is a pretty young project compared to others and obviously not the most famous map server in the free world. However, it's recklessly meaningful thanks to numerous inherent qualities, especially due to its tight integration with QGIS Desktop: ease of configuration, vendor requests and parameters or even Python plugins. Moreover, the underlying implementation is more and more robust and evidenced by the OGC certification recently renewed for the LTR.

During this presentation, we're going to explore QGIS Server from a global perspective by focusing on its main features, but also talk about its drawbacks. We'll also take a quick look on the CI infrastructure, true gate-keeper of the necessary quality for an industrial application worthy of the name. And you never know, maybe it will give you the taste to try ;)
